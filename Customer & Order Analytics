#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data

#1.How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product = 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(FebSales.orderID) = 6
AND FebSales.orderID <> 'Order ID';

#.4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT price, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT DISTINCT product, ROUND(SUM(price),2) AS sum
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product <> ""
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(price), location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
ORDER BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(customers.acctnum), AVG(FebSales.quantity*price) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND 'OrderID' <> "";

#8.List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.;

SELECT product, sum(quantity), location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
